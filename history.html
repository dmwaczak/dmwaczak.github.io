                In my current role at Chuy’s Tex-Mex, I balance multiple responsibilities, including serving, hosting, and managing to-go orders.
                This experience has sharpened my skills in multitasking, customer service, and communication. Working in a fast-paced environment
                while pursuing a double major has strengthened my ability to manage time and prioritize effectively.

            <p>
                As a cashier at Home Depot, I provided excellent customer service and resolved conflicts efficiently. This role enhanced my ability
                to work with point-of-sale systems and handle high-pressure situations. It also provided valuable experience in understanding
                technology applications within retail operations, which ties closely to my interests in finance and MIS.
