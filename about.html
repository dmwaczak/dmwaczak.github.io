        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Dylan Waczak, a Senior at the University of Oklahoma pursuing a double major in Finance and Management Information Systems (MIS).
            I’m passionate about the intersection of finance and technology and am driven to make a positive impact in the industry. Balancing a full course load of 15 credit hours while working 25–30 hours a week at Chuy’s in Norman has strengthened my ability to manage time effectively and prioritize responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics and work, I’m a proud member of Alpha Tau Omega, one of the nation's largest fraternities, where I actively participate in community service and philanthropy. These experiences have helped me develop strong collaboration, communication, and leadership skills, which I bring to every project and opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            My previous role as a cashier at Home Depot provided valuable experience in customer service, conflict resolution, and technology use, such as point-of-sale systems. This has further fueled my interest in the intersection of finance and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and am committed to utilizing my skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the finance and technology industry.
